# Project 2 #

This project is about POS tagging. There are 4 files for this project:

- [the ipython notebook file](Project2-problem-set.ipynb)
- [scorer code](scorer.py)
- [training data](oct27.train)
- [dev data](oct27.dev)

In the first part of this project, you will use the classifiers from your first project, and take the POS tagging as a standard classification problem. Before using any classifier, please make sure your implementation is correct. (The grade of the first project will be release later soon).

## Notice ##

In your submission, please include **all** your results in ipython notebook.
