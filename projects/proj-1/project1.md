# Project 1 #

This project is about sentiment classification. You will write code
for three different classifiers: Naive Bayes, perceptron, and averaged
perceptron. The scaffolding code is found in
[this ipython notebook](proj1-problem-set.ipynb). You'll also need this data:
- [training data](train-imdb.tar.gz)
- [training key](train-imdb.key)
- [development data](dev-imdb.tar.gz)
- [development key](dev-imdb.key)
- [sentiment vocabulary](sentiment-vocab.tff) by Wiebe et al
- [scorer code](scorer.py)

You can get all of this by cloning the entire course repository using
"git clone https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class.git".
If you've already done this, just update the proj-1 directory.

## Ipython notebook ##
This project involves
[ipython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), a web-based IDE
for python. Notebook allows us to provide you a code scaffolding, and
allows you to annotate your code with comments in
[Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and
[LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). Please take some time to
familiarize yourself with this coding environment. I'm currently using
the [2.0.0 version from GitHub](https://github.com/ipython/ipython),
and I'm finding it very stable.

## Some resources: ##

- [examples of ipython notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/master/examples/notebooks#a-collection-of-notebooks-for-using-ipython-effectively). Start with "Part 1."
- [a numerical python cheatsheet](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-python-xref.pdf)
  for matlab and R users
- [NLTK](http://nltk.org/), the Natural Language Toolkit, in Python. Note that [the book](http://nltk.org/book/) is available for free.
- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a machine learning library in python.

## Submission and honor policy ##

On T-square, you should submit your version of the project notebook,
and any accompanying python code needed to run your notebook. Please
also submit your response files to the test data using the appropriate
filenames (described in the last section of the notebook).

If you have questions about the assignment, please use the class
[email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gt-nlp-class-fa2013),
and not a personal email to the class staff.

Your work should be your own, so please do not discuss the details of
the assignment. You may of course help each other with understanding
the ideas discussed in lecture and the readings, and with basic
questions about programming in Python. There are implementations and
source code for many machine learning algorithms on the
internet. Please write the code for this assignment on your own,
without using these external resources.
