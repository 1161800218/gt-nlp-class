This homework is about labeled dependency parsing.

Choose a wikipedia page, and select three sentences to dependency
parse. You will prefer short sentences, but make sure there is a
verb. Identify the edge types. You may check your parse using the
[Stanford Parser](http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/index.jsp). Identify
at least one case where you disagree with the analysis that the
Stanford parser produces.

This manual defines the set of dependency types:
