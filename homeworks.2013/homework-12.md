Please help your classmates improve their final projects.  For two of
the final project presentations, ask a question that naturally arises
from the work. In addition, propose an idea for future work: for
example, to make the results more convincing, to give a more solid
theoretical foundation, or to apply the ideas of the project in a new
way. 

You may not use questions or ideas that were given by others in the
class, but you can feel free to use a question or idea that you
yourself asked during class.
