Tensions between the mayor of Canada’s largest city and its police
chief escalated on Sunday, with Rob Ford calling for the release of a
video that appears to show him smoking crack cocaine.

Mr. Ford used his weekly radio show to challenge Police Chief Bill
Blair, echoing comments made last Friday by his lawyer in connection
with a drug probe involving the Mayor’s friend Alessandro Lisi.

“I am asking you to release this video now,” Mr. Ford said. “Whatever
this video shows, folks, Toronto residents deserve to see it and
people need to judge for themselves.”

Chief Blair was not available for comment on Sunday. His spokesman,
Mark Pugash, said police are abiding by the rule of law by not
releasing the video or any other electronic devices seized in
connection with the drug investigation.

“The law requires us to turn evidence over to the courts,” Mr. Pugash
said in an interview. “They alone have the authority to decide how it
is treated.”
