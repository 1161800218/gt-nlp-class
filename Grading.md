The graded material for the course consists of:

- 14 short homework assignments. Most of these involve performing linguistic annotation on some text of your choice. Each assignment should take less than thirty minutes. You may skip two, but you must do homework #14, which involves giving feedback on the final project. Each homework is worth 2 points (24 total). This grade includes attendance on the due date, because we will discuss them in class. **You must bring paper copies of your homework to class.**
- 7 assigned projects. These involve building and using NLP techniques which are at or near the state-of-the-art. They must be done individually. Each project is worth 6 points (42 total).
- 1 independent project. This may be done in a group of up to three. It is worth 14 points, including points for the proposal, presentation, and report. This means you should spend roughly twice as long as you spend on each assigned project.
- 1 in-class midterm exam, worth 20 points. Barring a medical
emergency, you must take the exam on the day indicated in the schedule.

Students enrolled in the graduate number 7650 will have an additional,
research-oriented component to several of the project assignments.

Homeworks and projects are due at the beginning of class; students
should also bring a paper copy of the homework to class on the due date. Late homeworks will not be accepted; projects will be accepted up to three days late, at a penalty of 20% per day. This means that a project turned in at the end of class on the due date can receive a maximum score of 8/10 points towards your final grade. This late policy is intended to ensure fair evaluation for everybody.

One of the goals of the assigned work is to assess your individual progress in meeting the learning objectives of the course. You may discuss the homework and projects with other students, but your work must be your own -- particularly all coding and writing. Using external software resources is acceptable unless the assignment directs you not to, but you must clearly indicate which resources you have used. Using other peopleâ€™s text or figures without attribution is plagiarism, and is never acceptable.
