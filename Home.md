CS 4650 and 7650
==========
- **Course**: Natural Language Understanding
- **Instructor**: Jacob Eisenstein
- **Semester**: Fall 2013
- **Time**: Tuesdays and thursdays, 3:00-4:30pm

This course gives an overview of modern statistical techniques for
analyzing natural language. The rough organization is to move from
shallow bag-of-words models to richer structural representations of
how words interact to create meaning. At each level, we will discuss
the salient linguistic phemonena and most successful computational
models. Along the way we will cover machine learning techniques which
are especially relevant to natural language processing.

Learning goals:
- Acquire the fundamental linguistic concepts that are relevant to language
  technology. This goal will be assessed in the short homework assignments,
  midterm, and class participation.
- Analyze and understand state-of-the-art algorithms and statistical
  techniques for reasoning about linguistic data. This goal will be
  assessed in the midterm, the assigned projects, and class
  participation.
- Implement state-of-the-art algorithms and statistical techniques for
  reasoning about linguistic data. This goal will be assessed in the
  assigned and independent projects.
- Adapt and apply state-of-the-art language technology to new problems
  and settings. This goal will be assessed in the independent project.
- (7650 only) Read and understand current research on natural language
  processing. This goal will be assessed in assigned projects and
  classroom participation.

The assignments, readings, and schedule are subject to change, but I will
try to give as much advance notice as possible.
