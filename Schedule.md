CS 4650 and CS 7650 will meet jointly, on Mondays and Wednesdays from 3:05 - 4:25PM, in Howey (Physics) L3.

This is a provisional schedule. Check back in August for more details. But be aware that **there will be graded material due no later than the second week of the course (maybe even the first week).**

Readings and homeworks are final at the time of the class **before** they are due (e.g., wednesday readings are final on the preceding monday); problem sets are final on the day they are "out." Please check for updates until then.

### August 17: Welcome ###

- History of NLP and modern applications. Review of probability. 
- **Reading**: Chapter 1 of [Linguistic Fundamentals for NLP](http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00493ED1V01Y201303HLT020).
You should be able to access this PDF for free from a Georgia Tech computer.
- **Optional reading**: [Functional programming in Python](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/functional.html).
The scaffolding code in this class will make heavy use of Python's functional programming features, such as iterators, generators, list comprehensions, and lambda expressions. If you haven't seen much of this style of programming before, it will be helpful for you to read up on it before getting started with the problem sets.
- **Optional reading**: Section 2.1 of [Foundations of Statistical NLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/). A PDF version is accessible through the GT library.
- **Optional reading** includes [these](http://www.autonlab.org/tutorials/prob18.pdf) 
[other](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10701_sp11/slides/Overfitting_ProbReview-1-13-2011-ann.pdf) [reviews](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10701_sp11/slides/MLE_MAP_1-18-11-ann.pdf)
of probability.

### August 19: Supervised learning 1 (Naive Bayes) and sentiment analysis ###
- Bag-of-words models, naive Bayes, and sentiment analysis.
- Reading: my [notes](notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf?raw=true), chapter 3.
- Optional readings:
[Sentiment analysis and opinion mining](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/opinion-mining-sentiment-analysis-survey.html), especially parts 1, 2, 4.1-4.3, and 7;
[Chapters 0-0.3, 1-1.2 of LXMLS lab guide](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/readings/lxmls-guide.pdf?raw=true)

### August 24: Supervised learning 2 (Perceptron) and word sense disambiguation ###
- Discriminative classifiers: perceptron and passive-aggressive learning; word-sense disambiguation. 
- Optional supplementary reading: Parts 4-7 of [log-linear models](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/readings/collins-loglin.pdf?raw=true); [survey on word sense disambiguation](http://promethee.philo.ulg.ac.be/engdep1/download/bacIII/ACM_Survey_2009_Navigli.pdf)
- Optional advanced reading: 
[adagrad](jmlr.org/papers/v12/duchi11a.html); [passive-aggressive learning](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume7/crammer06a/crammer06a.pdf)

### August 26: Supervised learning 3 (Logistic regression) ###

- Logistic regression and online learning
- Reading: my [notes](notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf?raw=true), chapter 5.3-5.6.
- Optional supplementary reading: Parts 4-7 of [log-linear models](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/readings/collins-loglin.pdf?raw=true)
- [Slides](slides/lec4-slides.pdf?raw=true)

## The rest: TBD ##

Basic outline:

- Language models and finite state automata
- Sequence labeling: HMMs, CRFs, and structured perceptron
- Syntactic analysis: PCFGs, dependency parsing, and more
- Semantics: compositional logical semantics, shallow semantics, distributional semantics
- Information extraction: coreference, relation extraction
- Discourse relations and parsing
- Machine translation

You can see [last year's schedule](Schedule.2014.md) for a basic idea, but several things will be different this year as we will be doing a final exam rather than final projects.
