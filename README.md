Georgia Tech CS 4650 and 7650: Natural Language Understanding
============

This course gives an overview of modern statistical techniques for analyzing natural language. The rough organization is to move from shallow bag-of-words models to richer structural representations. At each level, we will discuss the salient linguistic phemonena and most successful computational models. Along the way we will cover machine learning techniques which are especially relevant to natural language processing.

The assignments, readings, and schedule are subject to change. I will try to give as much advance notice as possible.
