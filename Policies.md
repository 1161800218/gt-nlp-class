## Office hours ##

Professor Eisensteinâ€™s office hours will be 11-12 on wednesday in TSRB
228A. You can TSRB by showing your GTID at the desk. The office is to
the left of the stairs on the second floor.

TA's office hours will be 11-12 on Friday in the computational linguistics 
lab (the space next to TSRB 228A).  

## Prerequisites ##

This course assumes
- Good coding ability, corresponding to at least a third or
  fourth-year undergraduate CS major. Assignments will be in Python.
- Background in basic probability, linear algebra, and calculus.
- Understanding of automata and formal language theory: finite-state
  and context-free languages, NP-completeness, etc.
- Experience with dynamic programming algorithms.
- Familiarity with machine learning is *helpful but not assumed*. Of
  particular relevance are linear classifiers: perceptron, naive
  Bayes, and logistic regression.

People sometimes want to take the course without having all of these
prerequisites. Frequent cases are:
- Junior CS students with strong programming skills but limited
  theoretical and mathematical background,
- Non-CS students with strong mathematical background but limited
  programming experience.

Students in the first group suffer in the exam and don't understand
the lectures, and students in the second group suffer in the project
assignments. My advice is to get the background material first, and
then take this course.
