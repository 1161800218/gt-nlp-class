If you cannot make it to office hours, please email me to make an appointment. It is unlikely that I will be able to chat if you just stop by my office. The same is true for the TAs.

## In Class ##

A few basic points of classroom etiquette will make the class run more smoothly and effectively:

- Please arrive on time, so as not to disrupt other students while entering late.
- Turn off your phone to avoid embarrassing distractions.
- If you can't read something I wrote on the board, or if you think I made a mistake in a derivation, please raise your hand and tell me!

Multiple studies have shown that using a laptop in class -- even for taking notes -- reduces students' educational attainment. See [here](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/06/the-case-for-banning-laptops-in-the-classroom.html) for a popular press article summarizing this research. You are adults and must make your own decision, but my advice is to try pen and paper instead.
