Professor Eisensteinâ€™s office hours will be (TBD)

If you cannot make it to office hours, please email me to make an appointment. It is unlikely that I will be able to chat if you just stop by my office. The same is true for the TAs.

## In Class ##

Attendance will not be taken, but **you are responsible for knowing what happens in every class**. I will try to post slides and notes online, and to share announcements on T-Square, but there are no guarantees. So if you cannot attend class, make sure you check up with someone who was there.

Respect your classmates and your instructor by avoiding distractions. This means be there on time, turn off your cellphone, and save side conversations for after class. Also, if you can't read something I wrote on the board, or if you think I made a mistake in a derivation, please raise your hand and tell me!

Multiple studies have shown that using a laptop in class -- even for taking notes -- reduces students' educational attainment. See [here](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/06/the-case-for-banning-laptops-in-the-classroom.html) for a popular press article summarizing this research. You are adults and must make your own decision, but my advice is to try pen and paper instead.
