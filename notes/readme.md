Welcome to the latest "stable build" of my notes for Natural Language Processing. 
They are the basis for the readings in CS4650 and CS7650 at Georgia Tech.

You are welcome to use these notes and slides for your own edification, or for teaching, assuming you give attribution.
If you do use this material in a classroom setting, please tell me! 
This will help me justify the time that I have spent on them. 

Feedback of any kind is also welcome. You can reach me directly at jacobe gatech edu.
