# Homework 13: Exam prep #

Take the last digit of your birth date, and choose a class with the same final digit from the schedule. For example, my birth date is the 25th, so I'd choose the class on discriminative sequence labeling (Oct 5). Based on the material covered in that class, write a multiple choice question, in the same style as the midterm. Be sure to indicate the correct answer.

I've already written the final, so it's very unlikely that I use your question this year. But we'll talk about these questions in class, and I might use them next year.
