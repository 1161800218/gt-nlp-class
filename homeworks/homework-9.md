In this homework, you will RST annotation of a short passage of text.

First, divide the text into elementary discourse units (EDUs). You can
label each EDU as C0, C1, etc. Then provide an RST parse tree for the
text. You can indicate the discourse parse either through a graph or
through a list of relations. A description of the relations in RST can
be found at

Here is the passage:

- In today's society, college is ambiguous.
- We need it to live, but we also need it to love.
- Moreover, without college most of the world's learning would be egregious.
- College, however, has myriad costs.
- One of the most important issues facing the world is how to reduce college costs.
- Some have argued that college costs are due to the luxuries students now expect.
- Others have argued that the costs are a result of athletics.
- In reality, high college costs are the result
  of excessive pay for teaching assistants.
