In this homework, you will RST annotation of a short passage of text
from the
"[essay for robo-graders](http://bltnotjustasandwich.com/2012/06/10/les-perelmans-robo-graded-essay/)".

First, divide the text into elementary discourse units (EDUs). You can
label each EDU as C0, C1, etc. Then provide an RST parse tree for the
text. You can indicate the discourse parse either through a graph or
through a list of relations. A description of the relations in RST can
be found at

Here is the passage:

> Teaching assistants are paid an excessive amount of money. The average
> teaching assistant makes six times as much money as college
> presidents. In addition, they often receive a plethora of extra
> benefits such as private jets, vacations in the south seas, a staring
> roles in motion pictures. Moreover, in the Dickens novel Great
> Expectation, Pip makes his fortune by being a teaching assistant. It
> doesn’t matter what the subject is, since there are three parts to
> everything you can think of. If you can’t think of more than two, you
> just have to think harder or come up with something that might fit. An
> example will often work, like the three causes of the Civil War or
> abortion or reasons why the ridiculous twenty-one-year-old limit for
> drinking alcohol should be abolished. A worse problem is when you wind
> up with more than three subtopics, since sometimes you want to talk
> about all of them.

In my opinion, this text has two parts, and it’s not really possible
to reconcile them into a single tree. But you are welcome to try. At
a minimum, provide trees for each part.
